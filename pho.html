			<div class="title">IMPORTANT NOTES</div>
					<p>- For bones, I recommend using 2/3 meaty bones and 1/3 marrow bones/oxtails, so that the broth won’t be too greasy. For raw beef topping, you can use any type of tender beef cuts, just make sure to slice it very thinly and across the grains. Before eating, remember to allow the raw beef slices to come down to room temperature before adding hot broth! </p>
					<p>- For spices, I counted very carefully the number of each, so you MUST use the exact amount :P It’s best to use Ceylon cinnamon here because it is milder, sweeter and gives more sophisticated flavours than harsher Cassia cinnamon. </p>
					<p>- Don’t add fish sauce during the cooking process because it will make the broth sour. You can add them later but directly into your bowl of Pho. </p>

				  <h3>Directions</h3>
				<div class="items"> 
				<p>1. Submerge bones and ribs in cold water for 30 mins </p> 
				<p>2. Keep raw beef in fridge. 1 hour before eating, slice it very thinly and allow it to come down to room temperature. Tips: freezing beef for 1 hour will make slicing easier </p> 
				<p>3. Unpeeled ginger: halved lengthwise. </p> 
				<p>4. In a small pan, add coriander seeds, cardamom, star anises, cloves and toast for 3 mins under medium low heat, then set aside </p> 
				<p>5. Add ginger, cinnamon sticks and shallots. Remove cinnamon after 3 mins, charred shallots after 4 mins, ginger after 7 mins. </p> 
				<p>6. Remove pan, use a skewer to directly roast ginger in the fire for a few seconds. You should see some charred patches. </p> 
				<p>7. Rinse and gently scrape the loose burnt bits on ginger and shallots. </p> 
				<p>8. After 30 mins, discard water, wash and rinse bones & ribs. Add them to a big pot, add water to cover, parboil for 20 mins and discard water. Wash thoroughly under running water </p> 
				<p>9. Add them back into pot, fill with 2.8 litres of water, add 2 tbs salt, 2 tbs sugar, boil for 30 mins and skim any foam left. Then reduce to low heat, add ginger, shallots, and spices (in a tea strainer or a mousseline spice bag) </p> 
				<p>10. Cook for another 2 hours, then remove shallots and spices, skim fats if needed. </p> 
				<p>11. Remove ribs and add into a bowl of water. Continue simmering the broth, the longer the better! </p> 
				<p>12. Slice yellow onion into paper thin slices, and chop spring onions (green parts) finely as well </p> 
				<p>13. Slice ribs into thin slices and slice raw beef extra thin! </p> 
				<p>14. Cook noodle according to the package’s direction, rinse very well if needed. </p> 
				<p>15. Season the broth for the last time, add 1.5 tbs salt, 1.5 tbs sugar, 1tsp seasoning powder/msg or adjust them according to your taste bud. The broth needs to be salty and rich because the other ingredients are not seasoned. </p> 
				<p>16. Add noodles into individual bowls and microwave for 1 min each bowl to warm it up. We want our Pho pipping hot! </p> 
				<p>17. Add a layer of ribs meat, followed by a layer of raw beef on top, some onion slices and springs onions </p> 
				<p>18. Bring broth to rolling boil, pour hot broth directly on top of raw beef to cook them evenly, sprinkle some black peppers </p>
